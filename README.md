# SwiftUI Conditional Modifiers

This is an Xcode 12 project that builds an iOS application. It is designed to explore SwiftUI modifiers with an emphasis on using conditional statements to alter the modifiers on views based on application state.

This is very much a playground for discovery and sharing knowledge from my Swift posts and videos on [https://compileswift.com](https://compileswift.com).
